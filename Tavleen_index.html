    <p>

        The Pokémon Company, a company founded by Nintendo, Game Freak, and Creatures. The franchise was created by
        Satoshi Tajiri in 1996, and is centered on fictional creatures called "Pokémon". In Pokémon, humans, known as
        Pokémon Trainers, catch and train Pokémon to battle other Pokémon for sport. All media works within the
        franchise are set in the Pokémon universe. The English slogan for the franchise is "Gotta Catch ‘Em All!".[5][6]

    <h2> GARY </h2>
    <p>
        Gary Oak is Ash's first rival. He is based on the character Blue from the Pokémon video game series. Like his
        counterpart Blue, Gary hails from Pallet Town and is the grandson of renowned Pokémon researcher Professor Oak.
        Like Ash, Gary collects Gym badges and competes in Pokémon League tournaments in Kanto and Johto. At first, Gary
        is arrogant, always traveling with cheerleaders who called out his name and constantly teases Ash's group
        whenever they meet. After losing to a more powerful opponent in the Indigo League, Gary dispenses with the
        cheerleaders and then becomes more open-minded.
